Participate in BSides CDMX by attending or think about a topic for the ***Call for Papers*** or the ***Call for Workshops*** that you could present. This event is created and maintained by you and all the community and in order to make this happen we need your help!

You can support BSides CDMX by getting your conference tickets and all the support we get will be used to sponsor the event only; for instance SWAG. You can support BSides CDMX directly on the Welcome pannel at the venue. ;)
