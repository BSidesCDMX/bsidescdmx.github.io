      <center><strong>Sap Netweaver - Information disclosure vulnerability</strong></center>
      Talk to expose a vulnerability already reported for a long time to the manufacturer and that is still latent without an official solution, with a script to identify it and possible live or video demonstration, as it would be in the wild.

      <center><strong>Path Of LeAst Resistance - Accelerating the search for vulnerable functions</strong></center>
      When developing exploits for complex platforms, finding a function relationships between dynamically compiled binaries is of utmost importance to focus the exploitation efforts. By modeling the relationships as a Graph, and leveraging the power of Graph Databases we can quickly identify these relationships and answer some critical questions:
      <ul>
        <li> Are known vulnerable/problematic functions in use? </li>
        <li> Which binary uses a vulnerable function inside a library? </li>
        <li> What (unidentified) function imports a vulnerable function in a binary? </li>
      </ul>
      In this talk, I'll discuss Reverse Engineering, Graphs, Binary Relationships and Vulnerable Functions.

      <center><strong>Welcome Home! - how to be a hacker in few minutes</strong></center>
      Do you really need to be a skilled hacker to get complete control of someone’s smart home? Consumers would probably expect that, or might even think their smart home is completely secure. But the sad truth is that in reality, many “doors” in today’s smart homes are open. If there are closed doors, certainly you would be able to find a key under the mat, an open window, or at least a cat door. The common denominator is still the same: a lack of security, which is partially the fault of vendors, but also of users themselves. This talk is mainly, but not only, about the automation protocol MQTT widely used for interconnecting home automation devices and systems. I will demonstrate also how you how easy it is to get full access to someone’s connected home. Commonly used systems such as OpenHAB, HomeAssistant, MQTT Dash and others are quite often badly or not at all configured in terms of security. Even if there is a password set you can usually find another vulnerability at the same IP address that allows you to intrude the smart home.

      <center><strong>Reversing and Exploiting Telepresence Robots</strong></center>
      We all have heard of the existence of Robots to assemble cars, to clean your house, to deactivate bombs, for telepresence and even with its own autonomy as if it was a real human! It is a fantastic technology that involves multiple components to see, hear, speak and move, however, evidence of penetration to these humanoids is very limited, most likely because it is expensive to acquire these devices. During this talk you will know the technology behind these robots, techniques for reverse engineering and remote debugging, description of vulnerabilities found, one of which allowed remote access as root and demonstration of different scenarios where an attacker is able to steal information or monitor conversations, and last but not least ... Live Demo!

      <center><strong>Beyond 'grep strcpy' in code review</strong></center>
      There's a well-known list of low-hanging fruits when it comes to bug hunting in low level code (mostly C). Nevertheless, there are other type of bugs that are undetectable by automated static analysis tools, and it's here where the human expertise comes handy. In this talk we'll share some unconventional security bugs that we've come across in our last code audits. Despite most of these bugs are related to low level programming, some of them apply to high level languages that could be oriented to web or embedded systems. <br>
      Amongst the list of bugs to be shown are: 
      <ul>
        <li> Dead store optimizations </li>
        <li> Structure padding info leaks and type confusion bugs </li>
        <li> Arithmetic overflows leading to critical problems </li>
        <li> Wrong logical operators in conditional expressions </li>
        <li> Unchecked/Wrongly checked return values of critical functions </li>
        <li> Off-by-ones - Uninitialized data info leaks and memory corruptions </li>
        <li> Screwing up the order of your parameters on basic function calls </li>
        <li> Unchecked return values leading to mem corruptions / overflows </li>
        <li> Undefined behavior and security: Pointer arithmetic problems, Zero-size memory allocations </li>
        <li> Calloc/fread/fwrite arithmetic (a.k.a don't do arithmetic on the second argument) </li>
        <li> assert(), the best friend and worst enemy of developers </li>
        <li> Case sensitivity/insensitivity bugs </li>

      <center><strong>Murder Mystery – How Vulnerability Intelligence is Poisoning your Information Security Program.</strong></center>
      In order to solve many modern information security use-cases, organizations have evolved from making decisions based on information gleaned from silo-ed security solutions, towards making more intelligent decisions based upon shared security intelligence. However, integrating vulnerability scanning results into one’s security ecosystem involves a serious hidden challenge resulting in heinous consequences, thereby killing your InfoSec program. This session shares clues on this challenge, step by step, in the form of a Murder Mystery game, ultimately revealing the culprit and strategies to overcome it. Learn, participate, play, and interact! Try to guess “who-dunnit,” and how to avoid similar InfoSec crimes.

      <strong>Hernan Jesus Olguin Garcia</strong><br> 
      Mexican Cybernetic Engineer who started working in InfoSec field while he was still in the college as a Network Infrastructure and Information Security Manager at La Salle University in Mexico City. <br>
      He studied a MSc. in Microelectronic Engineering at IPN (Mexico City) and made a research stay at the University of Electrocommunications (Tokyo). In IPN, he studied InfoSec with a specialization about Steganography and Steganalysis, and in the University of Electrocommunications, he made his research about how to apply it inside network infrastructures. He has published 3 international scientific articles regarding Steganography and Steganalysis, has given many conferences about it, and is still researching about the field. <br>
      Jesus currently works in a worldwide acknowledged company in Information Security, Trustwave Inc, in Mexico City as a Security Researcher and is part of the SpiderLabs Database Security Team as a QA Engineer. He is a contributor in the Trustwave SpiderLabs blog talking about Steganography and Steganalysis.
      <center><strong>What is Steganography and how to eat it?</strong></center>
      In the XX century, the research about the steganography and steganalysis was not considered as a priority field, however in the XXI century, after the USA-9/11 attack, the study of this field has grown exponentially. During last decade, a large amount of methods have been proposed in the literature. In many cases, steganography is used to hide different types of information, such as a medical, business and personal information, for privacy purpose. However, steganography is also used for illegal purposes, such as pornography, people trade, counterintelligence, or to share confidential information among different government sectors, which may cause immense damages to society. <br>
      The Steganography is the art or science to hide information into digital cover files, such as audio, images, videos, etc. Its main goal is to achieve an undetectable communication between a transmitter and a receiver. The principal issues to be considered in this field of study are embedding capacity or payload, distortion or imperceptibility, robustness and tamper-resistance.<br>
      In this workshop, I will teach you the basis of steganography and how to code one of the most common and famous methods – LSB-R method – into images using JAVA. <br>
      It is not necessary to have any previous knowledge about the field, but you should have knowledge about basic JAVA coding. In this blog post, you can find some theory that will be given in the workshop: https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Steganography----what-is-that-/?page=1&year=0&month=0

      PhD from the University of New Brunswick, member of "The Honeynet project", I am currently working on a project where radare2 is "the tool" to extract the required information from the malware to analyze. The objective is to share the knowledge acquired and promote the use of this great tool (which apart is open source).
      <center><strong>Radare2 & cutter first steps through examples</strong></center>
      Radare2 is a very powerful framework commonly used to perform reverse engineering. In this workshop the participant will be guided to familiarize with the graphic interface "cutter" solving some "crackmes". The workshop will end with the development of a script (using r2pipe) to automate some tasks in the reversing. This workshop aims to provide the assistant with the minimum knowledge necessary to use radare2 in reversing tasks.
